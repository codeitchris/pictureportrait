# pictureportrait.
This repo contains all the code for the soon to be released picture portrait web app. 

Picture Portrait will use Spotify API to get a user's top artistis, and then generate a image of the user's top artistis using a fine tuned stable diffusion model. I'm doing this project to learn more about the web side of software and also to make something that people will value and use hopefully! 

# Tech Stack
It is a Node app written in Typescript with EJS. 

I'm currently fine-tuning the model on Kaggle. The training is using HF's dreambooth script, and is currently producing good results. I will add the juptyper notebook I'm using to this repo once I've completely settled on training- still ironing out some kinks and working on ways to automate the training jobs.
